We will see a few types of basic plots and how to create them with R base
graphics system

To create the plots we'll use a simple dataset representing the results of
an experiment measuring two proteins (`P1` and `P2`) in two groups cell types
with two conditions for each type: `treated` and `control`.


```{r}

western <- read.delim("./datasets/western.txt")
western

```

```{r}
table(western$Treated)
table(western$CellType)

table(western$Treated, western$CellType)


```

## Barplots

  Barplots represent single measures as the height of rectangles. They are 
  widely used (both with and without error bars) but they tend to hide most
  of the complexity of the data.
  
  Let's see how to plot the mean levels of one of the proteins, P1, in our
  samples. To do that, we first compute the means and then plot them using 
  [`barplot`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.5.2/topics/barplot). 

```{r}
means <- c(treated=mean(western$P1[western$Treated=="treated"]), control=mean(western$P1[western$Treated=="control"]))
barplot(means)
```

And we can separate also the measures by cell type

```{r}

means <- tapply(western$P1, list(western$CellType, western$Treated), mean)
means
```

and plot them one next to the other with `beside=TRUE`

```{r}
barplot(means, beside=TRUE, col = c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"), main="Levels of P1")
legend("topleft", legend = levels(western$CellType), fill =  c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"))
```

And we can make them horizontal with the `horiz` parameter

```{r}
barplot(means, beside=TRUE, col = c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"), main="Levels of P1", horiz = TRUE)
legend("bottomright", legend = levels(western$CellType), fill =  c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"))
```

## Boxplots

  Boxplots show a more information than barplots, since they show the median, 
  the interquartile range and usually single out outliers. To create a 
  boxplot we simply need to call the [`boxplot`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.5.2/topics/boxplot)
  function.

  In this case we do not have to compute the summary statistics ourselves, since
  they will be computed by the function itself.

```{r}
  boxplot(western$P1~western$Treated)
```

Using the same formula notation, we can separate the samples by cell type

```{r}
  boxplot(P1~CellType*Treated, data=western,  col =  c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"),
          ylab="P1 level")
```

With box plots we can see that there are more differences by celltype in the 
treated group than we saw using barplots.

However, when the total number of points allow it, it might make sense to add
the actual data points to the plot. We can doo that with [`stripchart`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.5.2/topics/stripchart).

```{r}
  stripchart(P1~CellType*Treated, data=western)
```

As you can see the defaults are... offputting and not very compatible with the 
boxplots we just created. but changing a couple of parameters the chart improves
quite a bit.

```{r}
 stripchart(P1~CellType*Treated, data=western, vertical=TRUE, pch=19)
```

and we can combine both charts into one using the `add` parameter of stripchart
so it does not start a new plot.

```{r}
  boxplot(P1~CellType*Treated, data=western,  ylab="P1 level")
  stripchart(P1~CellType*Treated, data=western, vertical=TRUE,
             add=TRUE, pch=19, col=c("dodgerblue", "skyblue"))
```

## Scatter plots

  Plotting data as simple points gives us additional possibilities. For example
  we can plot the values of P1 against the values of P2
  
```{r}
  plot(x=western$P1, y=western$P2)
```

And make it a bit more pleasing and informative

```{r}
  plot(x=western$P1, y=western$P2, main="P1 vs P2", xlab="P1 levels",
       ylab="P2 levels", pch=19)
```

and we can add a linear regression model

```{r}
 linearMod <- lm(western$P1 ~ western$P2)
 summary(linearMod) 
```

With this model it would seem that the levels of P1 and P2 are 
correlated and that both proteins and not independent.

We can even plot the regression line with [`abline`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.5.2/topics/abline)

```{r}
plot(x=western$P1, y=western$P2, main="P1 vs P2", xlab="P1 levels",
       ylab="P2 levels", pch=19)
abline(linearMod)
```

However, if we plot the treated and untreated cases and separate the cell types 
1 and 2 we'll see that the relation between the two proteins is not that clear.

```{r}
plot(x=western$P1, y=western$P2, main="P1 vs P2", xlab="P1 levels",
       ylab="P2 levels", col=western$Treated, pch=ifelse(western$CellType=="type1", 19, 12))
abline(linearMod)
legend("topleft", legend=c("type1", "type2"), pch=c(19, 12))
```

This is an example of [the Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox)
where the association between two variables may be reversed when the different
groups of data are studied independenly.

## Other basic graphs

### Lines

To plot lines we can either use `plot` with `type="l"` or use the `lines` 
function if a plot is already active.

```{r}
  x <- c(1:10)
  y <- c(3,5,6,3,7,8,5,7,10,5)
  plot(x=x, y=y, type="l")
```

  
```{r}
  plot(x=x, y=y)
  lines(x=x, y=y, lwd=4, lty=2)
```

### Rectangles

  To plot rectangles we have to specify to x's and two y's
  
```{r}
  plot(x=x, y=y)
  lines(x=x, y=y, lwd=4, lty=2)
  rect(xleft=4.5, xright=6.5, ybottom=6, ytop=9, col=NA, border="red", lwd=2)
```


### Text

  To plot text we can use the `text` function. It works in the same way `points`
  does, but with an additional `labels` argument.
  
```{r}
  plot(x=x, y=y)
  lines(x=x, y=y, lwd=4, lty=2)
  text(x=6, y=8, labels = "Important!", col="red", cex=2, pos=3)
```

## Graphical Parameters

You'll have noticed that most of these functions share certain parameters: `col`
for colors, `lwd` for width of lines, `cex` for text sizes...

Most of these parameters are standard but they are easy to forget. Going to
google and seraching for "R graphical parameters" will lead you [to pages 
explaining](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/graphical-parameters) [them in detail](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/par.html). With these parameters is how we can achieve 
## Saving plots

Use [`png`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.4.1/topics/png)
or [`pdf`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.5.2/topics/pdf) 
before plotting and call `dev.off()` to close the graphical device when you 
finish your plot.

**IMPORTANT!!!!** bitmap based devices specify the width and height in pixels,
but pdf do it in inches! Creating a 600inch pdf can lead to HUGE pdf that will 
probably hang your computer...

## Proposed work

  1 - Can you create a boxplot with the expression data you have from yesterday?
  2 - Can you set the box color according to the sample type?
  3 - Save the image as a pdf, 7 inches high, 12 wide. Add a main title and adjust the axis labeling, text size, etc...
  4 - Plot the correlation between samples NL1 and HCC1. 
  5 - Add a diagnoal line representing the perfect correlation.
  7 - Add a text label highlighting the gene with highest expression on HCC1 sample.
  6 - Save it as a png, 2000*2000 and adjust text sizes, axis labels to get a publication ready figure.
  7 - Can you create a new version of that image shwoing only the very low expressed genes?
